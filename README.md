# File Uploader (Expo + Firebase)

Minimal cross-platform app that supports:
- Email registration & login (Firebase Auth)
- File upload (expo-document-picker → Firebase Storage)
- Per-user uploads list with date/time (Firestore)

Quick start:
1. Install: `npm install` or `yarn`
2. Add your Firebase config to `src/firebase.js`
3. Start: `npm start` or `expo start`

See `src/` for implementation files and `firebase.rules` for example security rules.
